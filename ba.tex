    \section{Foreword}
        I would like to thank Hannes Leutloff, who was involved in developing
        the previous version of the survey tool and has spent countless hours
        building the user interface for the version presented here. \\

        To avoid confusion about which parts were developed by Hannes Leutloff,
        the author would like to unequivocally state that all parts of the
        survey tool discussed in this thesis, which equates to the entire
        server-side software, were designed and implemented by Noah Hummel.
        Hannes Leutloff designed and implemented the majority of the client-side
        user interface. The reader may assure themselves of this by
        examining the change history of the publicly accessible git repository,
        which is listed in the appendix of this work.
