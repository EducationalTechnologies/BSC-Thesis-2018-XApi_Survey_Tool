Learning analytics is a fast-growing branch of data science, which is enabled
by the increasing use of educational technologies and thus the availability of
large-scale data about the subject.
Combining this data with self-reported data from psychometrical surveys is a
research topic of interest to Prof. H. Drachlser's work group. 
Existing survey tools used for this application do not provide the xAPI capabilities
needed for integration with the trusted learning analytics infrastructure developed
by Prof. H. Drachsler's group.
In this thesis, the development of a web-based survey tool with xAPI support is described.
A requirements analysis is performed on the basis of an already existing prototype 
and a concept for meeting these requirements is presented. Some implementational
details, including a data model for content sharing between researchers, are discussed.
The resulting software is then analised for conceptual and implementational issues.
