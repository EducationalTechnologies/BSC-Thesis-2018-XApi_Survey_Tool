\section{Analysis \& Outlook}
    \subsection{Known Issues \& Caveats}
        Joined table inheritance is inferior to single table inheritance
        for this application, even if it looks ugly. Why: performance,
        no foreign key constraints that mess with you

        The template feature is too sophisticated, import and export would have sufficed
        this took time away

        No tests exist for the backend, major burden on maintainability

         the email adress of the data client who conducts the survey
    is added as a prefix to all xAPI activity IDs before sending.
    -> Drawback: not normalized, potential fix: use Instructor <-
